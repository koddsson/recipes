# Dijon Mustard Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup yellow mustard seeds (or a mix of yellow and brown)
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup vinegar (white, apple cider, white wine, or a mixture of the 3)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar

## Instructions

- Place all ingredients in a container with a top that holds at least 2 cups.
- Stir, cover and let sit for at least 3 days at room temperature.
- Pour mixture into a high-powered blender or food processor. Add additional seasoning or flavors (like grated horseradish).
- Blend at medium speed until the consistency is nice and creamy, scraping down the sides as you go.
- Add one tablespoon of warm water at a time during the blending process if mixture seems dry. Careful not to add too much or youâ€™ll end up with mustard soup!
- Transfer mustard to a clean, airtight container and store in the fridge.
- Note: The mustard may taste slightly bitter at first but a couple weeks in the fridge will mellow it nicely.
